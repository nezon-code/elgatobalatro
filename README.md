# elgatobalatro
some cat joker mod for the addicting deck building game "Balatro" by LocalThunk, providing a use for 3s, based on a balatro meme called "el gato balatro" (Balatro Cat)

This mod requires the lovely injector and the Steamodded balatro injector.

all credit, thanks, and code for the mod mostly goes to https://github.com/BBBalatroMod/BBBalatro , the author of which is Luke Soloman. the art is done by me, and the "El Gato Balatro" meme is from some whatsapp message between two people.
